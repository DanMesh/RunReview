# RunReview

This is a Java project intended to expand on the functionality of Garmin Connect or Strava for analysing data from a .FIT activity file from a Garmin device.
It is designed around the Forerunner 10 running watch.

## Dependencies
Coming soon...

## Notes
In its current state a .FIT file needs to be saved as `resources/testfile.fit` for the application to run.
